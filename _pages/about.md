I am a first-year PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley. I am advised by [Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/) and [Somayeh Sojoudi](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/). My research interests are control and optimization for energy and power systems.

Before coming to Berkeley, I recieved my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Pittsburgh and worked part-time for the Buildings and Connected Systems group at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory. 

I am supported by the Natoinal Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP).
