I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, advised by [Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/) and [Somayeh Sojoudi](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/). I am also a graduate student research assistant at the [Grid Integration Group](https://gridintegration.lbl.gov/) at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab.

My PhD research applies optimization and game theory to the operation and planning of modern electric power systems. I am particularly interested in developing theoretical frameworks to make sense of emerging paradigms for coordinating distributed energy resources, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps.
